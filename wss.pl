#
# wss	Estimate the working set size (WSS) for a process on Linux.
#
# USAGE: wss [options] PID duration(s)
#    eg,
#        wss 181 0.01	# measure PID 181 WSS for 10 milliseconds
#        wss -h		# full USAGE
#
# COLUMNS:
#	- RSS(MB): Resident Set Size (Mbytes). The main memory size.
#	- PSS(MB): Proportional Set Size (Mbytes). Accounting for shared pages.
#	- Ref(MB): Referenced (Mbytes) during the specified duration.
#	           This is the working set size metric.
#
# I could add more columns, but that's what pmap -X is for.
#
# WARNING: This tool uses /proc/PID/clear_refs and /proc/PID/smaps, and does
# pause the target process for some milliseconds while address maps are read.
# This can cause a short burst of latency for your application. For processes
# with a lot of RSS (>100 Gbytes), the pause may be 1 second or longer. This
# also activates some old kernel code that may not have been used in your
# environment before, and which mucks with page flags: I'd guess there is a
# risk of an undiscovered kernel panic (the Linux mm community should know
# whether my guess is justified or not, if you want an expert opinion). Test in
# a lab environment for your kernel versions, and consider this experimental:
# use at your on risk.
